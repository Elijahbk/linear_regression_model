# This README describes the API and notebook structure for the linear regression project.

- Place your trained model files (`best_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`) in this API directory for deployment.
- Use `prediction.py` as your FastAPI app entry point.
- Use `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
- Use `multivariate.ipynb` for data analysis and model training steps.
